# Graph Topic in Java

This Repo contains Java code examples and implementations related to graph data structures and algorithms.


## Introduction

In this Repo, you will find various Java code examples and implementations related to graphs. Graphs are a fundamental data structure used to represent relationships between objects. They are widely used in various domains such as computer networks, social networks, and optimization problems.

## Graph Data Structure

The graph data structure is used to represent a collection of vertices (nodes) and edges (connections) between them. This section contains Java code examples that demonstrate how to create and manipulate graphs using different representations such as adjacency matrix and adjacency list.

## Graph Traversal

Graph traversal algorithms are used to visit all the vertices of a graph in a systematic way. This section contains Java code examples for popular graph traversal algorithms such as depth-first search (DFS) and breadth-first search (BFS).

## Graph Algorithms

Graph algorithms are used to solve various problems related to graphs, such as finding the shortest path between two vertices, detecting cycles, and finding connected components. This section contains Java code examples for common graph algorithms such as Dijkstra's algorithm, Kruskal's algorithm, and topological sorting.
