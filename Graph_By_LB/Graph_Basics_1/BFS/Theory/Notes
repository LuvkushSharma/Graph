BFS : Breadth first search

 *  It is a traversal technique.

 *  BFS of a graph is an algorithm used to visit all the nodes of a given graph. In this traversal
 algorithm, one node is selected, and then all of the adjacent nodes are visited one by one.

 * An undirected graph is a graph where all the edges are bidirectional i.e. they point from source to destination
 and destination to source.

 * A graph is disconnected if at least two vertices of the graph are not connected by a path.
